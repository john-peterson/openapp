i am looking for a tool that turn back the clock on gradle project to specify version automatically always struggle for hours to avoid the gigantic gradle downloads 

call it CRADLE or something back to the cradle . turn a 8.10 platform 35 project back to 8.1 33. voila it just works!

cradle --gradle 8.1 --adk 33

success! you can now build it with what YOU have on hand. man tar vad man har - Swedish expression 

was a gigantic effort to find this and build it in termux. every gradle update is testing my patience on a poor connect long way from home . i end up spending more time to restore the gradle version than actual coding 


this project
---

this will build in termux WITHOUT downloading anything if you have gradle 8.1.1 java 17 platform 33 aapt2

the gain from the massive waste of space is reliable old apps. don't know why they care so desperately about it. on the opposite end is Haskell that is nearly impossible to even use five years old but has a small foot print 

that gradle want every minor version in a separate gigantic file is questioning the sanity of the java community. i hapen to love it but hate yhe downloads and the endless fight to restore the old versions in the settings 



~/.gradle/gradle.properties
android.aapt2FromMavenOverride=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/aapt2

and it will run out if memory over and over you have to use earlyoom and consider these settings that make it much slower

org.gradle.parallel=false
org.gradle.daemon=false
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx256m

either of these files should work for the platform 

sdkmanager --install  platform-tools "platforms;android-33"

# branch tags

they could have branch links from :spy but i have to use thst massive link. or openapp@spy but @ is used for users so another tag could name branches in the same project 

this is the gigantic branch link lacking a short cut but I will not use it because I never use the GUI

# :spy branch, global key listener

this will block fp-keys globally it is always waiting for key events nothing else unsure about background battery use

 it shows zero per cent for six hours. no division in foreground or background . it doesn't show up in battery list. key mapper on the other hand show massive battery use five for 13 minutes  and six percent 
for two hours. all key mappers are garbage 

the only thing i know about the device is this. that it exists   my phone is living proof 

gh search code fp-keys
